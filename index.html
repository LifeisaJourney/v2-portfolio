      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

            With years of research experience, my goal is to demonstrate my persistence in learning new programming languages. With my science background, I will use methodical approaches to tackling any challenges. Using the techniques that I’ve learned and will learn, I wish to hone in on something that will become my lifelong skill set. With the knowledge from General Assembly, I have an ambitious goal of building better websites in the field of science and technology.

            "An interactive 6x6 JavaScript game of a submarine that you have to shoot down. This game comes with a twist! The first position of the submarine is given. Then, the submarine will move in one of the directions (horizontally or vertically by one block). The player will have to guess which direction the submarine had moved to. Then, every time the player clicks and misses the target box, the submarine can move again. The highest chance of winning is at the beginning since it could range from 25% to 50% of getting it right on the first move. The submarine is on a 1x1 block. This web application was created using vanilla JavaScript and DOM."

            "The idea of this website is to find the nearest doctor based on the input for your zip code entered. The return results will list all doctors on a map and list based on distance. Each search inquiry will return ten results, with a search radius of ten miles. On the backend of the website, the zip code is converted into longitude and latitude for API search parameters. That data will be used to pull from BetterDoctor API that lists the closest doctors that are still accepting new patients. Then using MapBox, I rendered the doctor offices as markers on the map. This website pulls data from three API's (Mapbox, Google Map, and BetterDoctor) with access tokens fully hidden. Google API was used to convert zipcode into longitude and latitude. This web application was created mainly with React.js."

After registering and logging in to the website, you have most CRUD features on your album collection and your personal profile. In addition, you can update you can also visit other collector’s that have the same vinyl. Searching for a particular album in the database also works. This full-stack web application was created with React.js for frontend and Express.js, Node.js as backend and Sequelize.js as ORM. Using JSON web token with bcrypt, we used the standard protocol for protecting the password."

I built this website with the front end of the application separate from the backend database. There are three main models: User, Post, and Comment. At the moment, full CRUD capabilities on the Post model. With Ruby on Rails, I created the database and association pathways. Then, I used React to pull that data from Rails by using API fetch calls. This full-stack web application was created with React.js for frontend and Ruby on Rails as a framework for the backend."
